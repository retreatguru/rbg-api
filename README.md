IMPORTANT: Booking Guru API docs have moved
==========================

**We now have a better documentation at https://secure.retreat.guru/api.**

The updated docs have examples in multiple languages and a lot more details.

The following remains here for posterity only and will eventually be retired.

Booking Guru API v1.0
=====================

Welcome to the Booking Guru API, we're glad you could make it. Let's poke around a bit.

And just in case you have no idea where you are, [Booking Guru](http://bookingsoftware.guru)
is a software package for spiritual retreat centers to manage programs, registrations, finances
and everything in between.

## Security token

The first thing you'll need is the security token for your installation. Go to the Reg. Settings
on your install, select the API tab and grab the token that appears there.

![](img/token.png "Where is my token?")

If there isn't a token there yet, hit *Generate Token*, then *Save changes* and then copy the token.

Set a couple of environment variables so it's easier to run the samples:

```
$ export RGDOMAIN=<domain>
$ export RGTOKEN=<token>
```

The `<domain>` is your install's domain, and `<token>` is the token you just got from the admin UI.

Lets take a look at some data.

## Curl examples

Get programs:

```
$ curl "https://$RGDOMAIN/api/v1/programs?token=$RGTOKEN"
```

Get registations:

```
$ curl "https://$RGDOMAIN/api/v1/registrations?token=$RGTOKEN"
```

Get transactions:

```
$ curl "https://$RGDOMAIN/api/v1/transactions?token=$RGTOKEN"
```

## More examples

More examples in different programming languages are available in [examples/](https://github.com/retreatguru/rbg-api/tree/master/examples).

## API Reference

Following is the reference for the requests you can currently do against the API.

*Notes:*

1. All values with the `date` type are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, all values with the `date-time` type are in the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` format.
   The special value `today` can also be used with any date argument.

2. If a parameters can take multiple values (the `id` parameter usually does), provide multiple values separated by commas without spaces.
